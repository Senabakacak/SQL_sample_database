# SQL_sample_database
I created a new database here. I applied functions, ddl, dml, orderby, groupby ,joins,user defined function,stored procedure,trigger themes on the database I created.

# WHAT IS SQL SERVER?

The SQL Server is a relational database management system from Microsoft. The system is designed and built is to manage and store information. The system supports various business intelligence operations, analytics operations, and transaction processing.

# FUNCTIONS IN SQL
SQL server functions are sets of SQL statements that execute a specific task. Their main use is in allowing common tasks to be easily replicated. The use of SQL server functions is similar to that of functions in mathematics, in that they correlate a series on inputs to a series of outputs.
NCHAR,AVG,SUM,COUNT,MAX,MIN,SUM,GETDATE,DATEDIFF,CAST...

# JOINS 

Joining is the process of taking data from multiple tables and putting it into one generated view. So, an SQL Join clause in a Select statement combines columns from one or more tables in a relational database and returns a set of data.

# USER DEFINED FUNCTION
Like functions in programming languages, SQL Server user-defined functions are routines that accept parameters, perform an action, such as a complex calculation, and return the result of that action as a value. The return value can either be a single scalar value or a result set.

# DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE
DDL is short name of Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.
ALTER – alters the structure of the existing database.
DROP – delete objects from the database.
CREATE – to create database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function and triggers).

# DATA MANIPULATING LANGUAGE

DML is short name of Data Manipulation Language which deals with data manipulation, and includes most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE etc, and it is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in database.
UPDATE – updates existing data within a table.
DELETE – delete all records from a table.
INSERT – insert data into a table.

# STORED PROCEDURE
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

# TRIGGERS
A SQL trigger is a database object which fires when an event occurs in a database. We can execute a SQL query that will "do something" in a database when a change occurs on a database table such as a record is inserted or updated or deleted. For example, a trigger can be set on a record insert in a database table
